#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! StarFund Escrow Contract
//!
//! Holds investor funds for an invoice until settlement.
//! - SME receives stablecoin when funding target is met ([`StarfundEscrow::withdraw`])
//! - SME records optional **collateral commitments** ([`StarfundEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`]) ΓÇö
//!   these are **ledger records only**; they do **not** move tokens, freeze balances,
//!   reserve assets, or create an enforceable on-chain claim.
//! - [`StarfundEscrow::settle`] finalizes the escrow after maturity (when configured).
//!
//! ## Schema version ([`SCHEMA_VERSION`] / [`DataKey::Version`])
//!
//! The constant [`SCHEMA_VERSION`] is written to [`DataKey::Version`] by [`StarfundEscrow::init`]
//! and is the canonical source of truth for upgrade decisions. **Current value: 6.**
//!
//! [`StarfundEscrow::migrate`] **fails with typed errors in all current execution paths** ΓÇö no
//! silent migration work is promised or performed. Operators must extend `migrate` before calling
//! it, or redeploy when stored struct layout changes. See `docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md` for the full
//! decision tree.
//!
//! ## Event topic versioning ([`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`])
//!
//! Every lifecycle event emitted by this contract includes a schema version
//! as the second topic element: `(event_name, EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, ...)`.
//! The version is set by the [`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] constant and lets
//! off-chain consumers detect breaking changes before parsing the payload.
//! The required payload fields for each event are stable within a schema
//! version; a bump to [`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] means new events or fields may
//! be present, and consumers should switch on this version explicitly.
//!
//! ## SME collateral commitment metadata
//!
//! [`StarfundEscrow::record_sme_collateral_commitment`] is an SME-authenticated metadata write for
//! off-chain risk review. The stored [`SmeCollateralCommitment`] and emitted
//! [`CollateralRecordedEvt`] are not proof of custody, lien, encumbrance, asset control, or token
//! movement. Risk teams and indexers must label this state as reported collateral metadata and must
//! verify supporting evidence outside this contract.
//!
//! ## Compliance hold (legal hold)
//!
//! An admin may set [`DataKey::LegalHold`] to block risk-bearing transitions until cleared:
//! [`StarfundEscrow::settle`], SME [`StarfundEscrow::withdraw`], and
//! [`StarfundEscrow::claim_investor_payout`]. **Clearing** requires the **current**
//! [`InvoiceEscrow::admin`] to call [`StarfundEscrow::set_legal_hold`] with `active = false`
//! (or [`StarfundEscrow::clear_legal_hold`]). This contract does not embed a timelock or
//! council multisig: production deployments **must** use a governed `admin` (multisig or
//! protocol DAO) so a single lost key cannot strand funds indefinitely.
//!
//! **Failure mode:** a hold plus loss of the current admin signing key leaves funds blocked
//! on-chain until governance regains control of admin authority. There is no break-glass bypass.
//!
//! **Recovery lever:** [`StarfundEscrow::propose_admin`] and
//! [`StarfundEscrow::accept_admin`] are **not** gated by the hold. Governance proposes a new
//! admin, the proposed address accepts, then the new admin clears the hold. Invariant: a hold is
//! always clearable by whoever holds `InvoiceEscrow::admin`; recovery requires controlling that
//! authority. See `docs/escrow-legal-hold.md` and [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-legal-hold.md).
//!
//! ## Authorization guard ordering
//!
//! Every state-mutating entrypoint follows a canonical sequence (see
//! `docs/escrow-security-checklist.md` ┬º6 and [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-auth-boundaries.md)):
//!
//! 1. **Read-only** preconditions (legal hold, status checks, input validation).
//! 2. **`Address::require_auth()`** for the bound role ([Stellar authorization](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/auth/contract-authorization)).
//! 3. **Storage writes** and **SEP-41 transfers** (via [`external_calls`]).
//!
//! Invariant: no instance/persistent storage mutation and no token transfer occurs until
//! step 2 succeeds. Reading [`DataKey::Escrow`] before `require_auth` is intentional ΓÇö it is
//! read-only and does not weaken the auth boundary.
//!
//! ## Invoice identifier (`invoice_id`)
//!
//! At initialization, `invoice_id` is supplied as a Soroban [`String`] and validated for length
//! and charset before conversion to [`Symbol`] for storage. Align off-chain invoice slugs with the
//! same rules (ASCII alphanumeric + `_`, max length [`MAX_INVOICE_ID_STRING_LEN`]) so indexers stay
//! unambiguous.
//!
//! ## Funding token and registry (immutable hints)
//!
//! Each escrow instance binds exactly one **funding token** contract ([`DataKey::FundingToken`])
//! at [`StarfundEscrow::init`]; it cannot be changed after deploy. An optional **registry**
//! ([`DataKey::RegistryRef`]) is a read-only discoverability hint only ΓÇö it is **not** an authority
//! for this contract and must not be used on-chain as proof of registry state without calling the
//! registry yourself.
//!
//! ## Terminal dust sweep
//!
//! [`StarfundEscrow::sweep_terminal_dust`] moves at most [`MAX_DUST_SWEEP_AMOUNT`] units of the
//! bound funding token from this contract to the immutable **treasury** address, only when the
//! escrow has reached a **terminal** [`InvoiceEscrow::status`] (settled, withdrawn, or cancelled).
//! It cannot run during a legal hold. Transfers go through [`crate::external_calls`] so **pre/post
//! token balances** must match the requested amount (standard SEP-41 behavior); fee-on-transfer or
//! malicious tokens are **explicitly out of scope** and fail with typed errors at the balance-check
//! boundary. This is meant for rounding residue / stray transfers, not for settling live liabilities ΓÇö
//! integrations that custody principal on-chain must keep token balances reconciled with
//! `funded_amount` so treasury sweeps cannot pull user funds.
//!
//! ## Ledger time trust model
//!
//! [`StarfundEscrow::settle`] and [`StarfundEscrow::claim_investor_payout`] compare against
//! [`Env::ledger`] timestamps only (no wall-clock oracle). Maturity, per-investor **claim locks**
//! from [`StarfundEscrow::fund_with_commitment`], and [`FundingCloseSnapshot`] metadata must be
//! interpreted as **validator-observed ledger time**, including possible skew between simulated and
//! live networksΓÇöintegrators should treat boundaries as `>=` / `<` tests on integer seconds.
//!
//! ## Optional tiered yield (immutable table at init)
//!
//! Pass `yield_tiers` to [`StarfundEscrow::init`] as [`Option`] of a Soroban [`Vec`] of [`YieldTier`].
//! The table is **immutable** for the escrow instance. Investors who use [`StarfundEscrow::fund_with_commitment`]
//! on their **first** deposit select an effective [`DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield`] from the ladder;
//! further principal from that address must use [`StarfundEscrow::fund`]. **Fairness:** tiers are
//! validated non-decreasing in both `min_lock_secs` and `yield_bps` relative to the base [`InvoiceEscrow::yield_bps`].
//!
//! ## Funding-close snapshot (pro-rata)
//!
//! When status first becomes **funded**, [`DataKey::FundingCloseSnapshot`] stores total principal
//! (including over-funding past target), the target, and ledger timestamp/sequence. **Immutable** once
//! written; see `docs/escrow-pro-rata.md` for the authoritative pro-rata payout math and rounding rules.
//! Off-chain share for an investor is `get_contribution(addr) / snapshot.total_principal`.
//!
//! ## Immutable protocol fee (SME disbursement split)
//!
//! [`StarfundEscrow::init`] accepts an optional `protocol_fee_bps` (basis points, `0..=10_000`,
//! default `0`) stored immutably under [`DataKey::ProtocolFeeBps`]. At
//! [`StarfundEscrow::withdraw`] the funded principal is split:
//!
//! ```text
//! fee        = funded_amount * protocol_fee_bps / 10_000   (floor, checked)
//! sme_payout = funded_amount - fee                          (checked)
//! ```
//!
//! `fee` is routed to [`DataKey::Treasury`] and `sme_payout` to [`InvoiceEscrow::sme_address`].
//! **Conservation invariant:** `sme_payout + fee == funded_amount` for every withdrawal, so no
//! principal is created or destroyed by the split. Rounding is **floor**, so any sub-`10_000`
//! residue stays with the SME (never over-charges the treasury). With `protocol_fee_bps == 0`
//! the behavior is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-fee contract: the full `funded_amount`
//! goes to the SME and no treasury transfer occurs.
//!
//! **Interaction with on-chain disbursement:** the fee is only realized when principal is
//! custodied on-chain and the SME calls [`StarfundEscrow::withdraw`] ΓÇö this feature depends on
//! the on-chain disbursement path. It does **not** apply to off-chain settlement
//! ([`StarfundEscrow::settle`]), investor refunds ([`StarfundEscrow::refund`]), or investor
//! claims ([`StarfundEscrow::claim_investor_payout`]). The treasury here is the same immutable
//! address used by [`StarfundEscrow::sweep_terminal_dust`]; the fee transfer reuses the same
//! SEP-41 balance-deltaΓÇôchecked path in [`external_calls`].
